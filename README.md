# Clocks (in GO)

Some clock ideas

### forward\_momentum 

Clock prints unixtime, because it only ever goes up

### secs\_remaining

Clock prints number of seconds left between your age and the average life expectancy (a little dark I know)
This clock's numbers only go down

### bars 

Clock prints hours, minutes and seconds in bar graph format
